<p>This is a year-long course in mechatronics theory and design.  Feel free to branch and improve the website content as you see fit.</p>

<h3>Setting Up the Raspberry Pi</h3>
<p>We will be using the Raspberry Pi 3B+ in this course.  We will set up a Secure Shell (SSH) connection to the Pi so we may program it remotely from another computer.  Initially, we will use a keyboard, mouse and monitor but once the SSH is set up we will not need those anymore.  If you have a desktop computer a keyboard, mouse and monitor you can use those temporarily and then reconnect them once the SSH is set up.</p>
<p><b>To get started with the Raspberry Pi, we need the following equipment:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>Raspberry Pi 3B+</li>
  <li>32GB Micro SD Card with SD card slot adapter</li>
  <li>Monitor</li>
  <li>Keyboard</li>
  <li>Mouse</li>
  <li>HDMI cable</li>
  <li>Internet Access</li>
  <li>Second Computer</li>
